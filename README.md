# OUTDATED PROJECT

I can no longer work on this due to Securly adding a JavaScript disabler. If you try to run JavaScript even outside of a class, it will let your teacher know and it won't run.<br>
Due to this, I can no longer work on anything but webpages and games, not bookmarklets. Sorry for everyone that used these...<br>
Ron's House still works though, woohoo!

# IMPORTANT NOTICES

NONE of these bookmarklets will work on chrome://newtab <br>
I don't work on this during the summer.

# PLEASE READ ME

Make sure to star this repo so I can rise to the top!<br>
i cannot do unblockers, but if you get ahold of the html file for a webpage, you can use it without securly getting in the way sometimes<br>
Make sure to watch it for updates on when i release new hacks! (almost everyday!)<br>
Use discussions to ask questions and suggest hacks please!<br>
I am now on the fith page page when searching, "School Bookmarklets"! :(<br>

# I need some help

I need someone to help me manage this repository. It is EXTREMELY annoying to keep this repo updated and correct becuase of some small things:<br>
<br>
1. The all hacks file has to be  updated for every new hack<br>
2. Simple ideas i can write are hard to come up with<br>
3. I cant just "move" a file, i have to go and rename everything in the file to the new file path.<br>
<br>
See bottom for information on how to become a contributor (editor who can add bookmarklets)

# About

This project is something to pass the time. its also for kids who need this stuff, but basically i am making original bookmarklets that are meant to be used for: CHEATING, HACKING, BYPASSING & Random fun crap idk XD<br>
ChatGPT helps bug-fix stuff, and also wrote some of these scripts.<br>
The problem with ChatGPT is that its trained not to make this stuff, so i have to trick it into thinking im a teacher. but most of the time it fails to make a working script XD
